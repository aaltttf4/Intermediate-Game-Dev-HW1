I tried to make a game where you can play as a cockroach and you run around trying to eat everyone's leftovers. I wanted to add a variety of food items that could be found in a dorm. This game was inspired by my friend's dorm where they found a roach. I did add a few different kinds of foods, but looking back, they look too uneaten to really be counted as leftovers, they look more like someone just left a bunch of food on the ground. I also thought about making people that stand around or maybe even more rooms than one, but I didn't know how to make enemies that move around on their own. I learned about how to add collisions and audio. I forgot about adding an audio source to the gameObject so I did it a different way, but now I know how to add audio sources.
